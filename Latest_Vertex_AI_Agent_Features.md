Based on the research, here's what I found about file submission capabilities in Vertex AI Agent Builder:

# File Submission Capabilities in Vertex AI Agent Builder

## End-User File Submission

1. **Image Submission**
   - Users can submit images to the agent in base64 format
   - The agent can analyze and answer questions about submitted images
   - This requires specific API configuration in the request body

2. **Document Handling**
   - Primary document handling is done through datastores
   - Documents must typically be uploaded to Cloud Storage first
   - Real-time document submission by end-users is limited

## Current Limitations

1. **File Upload Process**
   - No direct file upload interface in the default chat UI
   - File submission requires API integration
   - Base64 encoding required for image files

2. **Data Store Constraints**
   - Main document repository must be pre-loaded
   - Cannot dynamically add files to datastore during chat
   - Maximum of 100,000 files per batch import

## Workarounds

1. **API Integration**
   - Custom frontend implementation required for file uploads
   - Need to handle file conversion to base64 (for images)
   - Must implement proper error handling and size limitations

2. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Use Cloud Storage as intermediate storage
   - Implement custom file processing pipeline
   - Create specialized endpoints for file handling

## Best Practices

1. **File Processing**
   - Pre-process files before submission
   - Implement size and format validation
   - Handle different file types appropriately

2. **Security Considerations**
   - Implement proper file validation
   - Set up appropriate access controls
   - Monitor for potential misuse

The current implementation primarily focuses on pre-loaded datastores rather than real-time file submissions. While it's possible to handle file submissions through custom implementations, it requires additional development work and isn't available as an out-of-the-box feature in the standard chat interface.
