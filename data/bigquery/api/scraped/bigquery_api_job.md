Fields




query

string
[Required] SQL query text to execute. The useLegacySql field can be used to indicate whether the query uses legacy SQL or GoogleSQL.



destinationTable

object (TableReference)
Optional. Describes the table where the query results should be stored. This property must be set for large results that exceed the maximum response size. For queries that produce anonymous (cached) results, this field will be populated by BigQuery.



tableDefinitions

map (key: string, value: object (ExternalDataConfiguration))
Optional. You can specify external table definitions, which operate as ephemeral tables that can be queried. These definitions are configured using a JSON map, where the string key represents the table identifier, and the value is the corresponding external data configuration object.



userDefinedFunctionResources[]

object (UserDefinedFunctionResource)
Describes user-defined function resources used in the query.



createDisposition

string
Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:

CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result.
The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.



writeDisposition

string
Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported:

WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the data, removes the constraints, and uses the schema from the query result.
WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
The default value is WRITE_EMPTY. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.



defaultDataset

object (DatasetReference)
Optional. Specifies the default dataset to use for unqualified table names in the query. This setting does not alter behavior of unqualified dataset names. Setting the system variable @@dataset_id achieves the same behavior. See https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/system-variables for more information on system variables.



priority

string
Optional. Specifies a priority for the query. Possible values include INTERACTIVE and BATCH. The default value is INTERACTIVE.



preserveNulls

boolean
[Deprecated] This property is deprecated.



allowLargeResults

boolean
Optional. If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, allows the query to produce arbitrarily large result tables at a slight cost in performance. Requires destinationTable to be set. For GoogleSQL queries, this flag is ignored and large results are always allowed. However, you must still set destinationTable when result size exceeds the allowed maximum response size.



useQueryCache

boolean
Optional. Whether to look for the result in the query cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed whenever tables in the query are modified. Moreover, the query cache is only available when a query does not have a destination table specified. The default value is true.



flattenResults

boolean
Optional. If true and query uses legacy SQL dialect, flattens all nested and repeated fields in the query results. allowLargeResults must be true if this is set to false. For GoogleSQL queries, this flag is ignored and results are never flattened.



maximumBillingTier

integer
Optional. [Deprecated] Maximum billing tier allowed for this query. The billing tier controls the amount of compute resources allotted to the query, and multiplies the on-demand cost of the query accordingly. A query that runs within its allotted resources will succeed and indicate its billing tier in statistics.query.billingTier, but if the query exceeds its allotted resources, it will fail with billingTierLimitExceeded. WARNING: The billed byte amount can be multiplied by an amount up to this number! Most users should not need to alter this setting, and we recommend that you avoid introducing new uses of it.



maximumBytesBilled

string (Int64Value format)
Limits the bytes billed for this job. Queries that will have bytes billed beyond this limit will fail (without incurring a charge). If unspecified, this will be set to your project default.



useLegacySql

boolean
Optional. Specifies whether to use BigQuery's legacy SQL dialect for this query. The default value is true. If set to false, the query will use BigQuery's GoogleSQL: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/sql-reference/When useLegacySql is set to false, the value of flattenResults is ignored; query will be run as if flattenResults is false.



parameterMode

string
GoogleSQL only. Set to POSITIONAL to use positional (?) query parameters or to NAMED to use named (@myparam) query parameters in this query.



queryParameters[]

object (QueryParameter)
jobs.query parameters for GoogleSQL queries.



schemaUpdateOptions[]

string
Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the query job. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:

ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.




timePartitioning

object (TimePartitioning)
Time-based partitioning specification for the destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be specified.



rangePartitioning

object (RangePartitioning)
Range partitioning specification for the destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be specified.



clustering

object (Clustering)
Clustering specification for the destination table.



destinationEncryptionConfiguration

object (EncryptionConfiguration)
Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys)



scriptOptions

object (ScriptOptions)
Options controlling the execution of scripts.



connectionProperties[]

object (ConnectionProperty)
Connection properties which can modify the query behavior.



createSession

boolean
If this property is true, the job creates a new session using a randomly generated sessionId. To continue using a created session with subsequent queries, pass the existing session identifier as a ConnectionProperty value. The session identifier is returned as part of the SessionInfo message within the query statistics.The new session's location will be set to Job.JobReference.location if it is present, otherwise it's set to the default location based on existing routing logic.



systemVariables

object (SystemVariables)
Output only. System variables for GoogleSQL queries. A system variable is output if the variable is settable and its value differs from the system default. "@@" prefix is not included in the name of the System variables.







SystemVariables

System variables given to a query.

Fields




sourceUris[]

string
[Required] The fully-qualified URIs that point to your data in Google Cloud. For Google Cloud Storage URIs:  Each URI can contain one '*' wildcard character and it must come after  the 'bucket' name. Size limits related to load jobs apply to external  data sources. For Google Cloud Bigtable URIs:  Exactly one URI can be specified and it has be a fully specified and  valid HTTPS URL for a Google Cloud Bigtable table. For Google Cloud Datastore backups:  Exactly one URI can be specified. Also, the '*' wildcard character is not  allowed.



fileSetSpecType

enum (FileSetSpecType)
Optional. Specifies how source URIs are interpreted for constructing the file set to load. By default, source URIs are expanded against the underlying storage. You can also specify manifest files to control how the file set is constructed. This option is only applicable to object storage systems.



schema

object (TableSchema)
Optional. The schema for the destination table. The schema can be omitted if the destination table already exists, or if you're loading data from Google Cloud Datastore.



destinationTable

object (TableReference)
[Required] The destination table to load the data into.



destinationTableProperties

object (DestinationTableProperties)
Optional. [Experimental] Properties with which to create the destination table if it is new.



createDisposition

string
Optional. Specifies whether the job is allowed to create new tables. The following values are supported:

CREATE_IF_NEEDED: If the table does not exist, BigQuery creates the table.
CREATE_NEVER: The table must already exist. If it does not, a 'notFound' error is returned in the job result. The default value is CREATE_IF_NEEDED. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.




writeDisposition

string
Optional. Specifies the action that occurs if the destination table already exists. The following values are supported:

WRITE_TRUNCATE: If the table already exists, BigQuery overwrites the data, removes the constraints and uses the schema from the load job.
WRITE_APPEND: If the table already exists, BigQuery appends the data to the table.
WRITE_EMPTY: If the table already exists and contains data, a 'duplicate' error is returned in the job result.
The default value is WRITE_APPEND. Each action is atomic and only occurs if BigQuery is able to complete the job successfully. Creation, truncation and append actions occur as one atomic update upon job completion.



nullMarker

string
Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value when loading a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.



fieldDelimiter

string
Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (",", U+002C).



skipLeadingRows

integer
Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when loading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:

skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the  first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise  data is read starting from the second row.
skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and  data should be read starting from the first row.
skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect  headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped.  Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.




encoding

string
Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.If you don't specify an encoding, or if you specify a UTF-8 encoding when the CSV file is not UTF-8 encoded, BigQuery attempts to convert the data to UTF-8. Generally, your data loads successfully, but it may not match byte-for-byte what you expect. To avoid this, specify the correct encoding by using the --encoding flag.If BigQuery can't convert a character other than the ASCII 0 character, BigQuery converts the character to the standard Unicode replacement character: �.



quote

string
Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ('"'). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character ' " ', use ' "" '. @default "



maxBadRecords

integer
Optional. The maximum number of bad records that BigQuery can ignore when running the job. If the number of bad records exceeds this value, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is 0, which requires that all records are valid. This is only supported for CSV and NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON file formats.



schemaInlineFormat

string
[Deprecated] The format of the schemaInline property.



schemaInline

string
[Deprecated] The inline schema. For CSV schemas, specify as "Field1:Type1[,Field2:Type2]*". For example, "foo:STRING, bar:INTEGER, baz:FLOAT".



allowQuotedNewlines

boolean
Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.



sourceFormat

string
Optional. The format of the data files. For CSV files, specify "CSV". For datastore backups, specify "DATASTORE_BACKUP". For newline-delimited JSON, specify "NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON". For Avro, specify "AVRO". For parquet, specify "PARQUET". For orc, specify "ORC". The default value is CSV.



allowJaggedRows

boolean
Optional. Accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. The missing values are treated as nulls. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. Only applicable to CSV, ignored for other formats.



ignoreUnknownValues

boolean
Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow extra values that are not represented in the table schema. If true, the extra values are ignored. If false, records with extra columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false. The sourceFormat property determines what BigQuery treats as an extra value:  CSV: Trailing columns  JSON: Named values that don't match any column names in the table schema  Avro, Parquet, ORC: Fields in the file schema that don't exist in the  table schema.



projectionFields[]

string
If sourceFormat is set to "DATASTORE_BACKUP", indicates which entity properties to load into BigQuery from a Cloud Datastore backup. Property names are case sensitive and must be top-level properties. If no properties are specified, BigQuery loads all properties. If any named property isn't found in the Cloud Datastore backup, an invalid error is returned in the job result.



autodetect

boolean
Optional. Indicates if we should automatically infer the options and schema for CSV and JSON sources.



schemaUpdateOptions[]

string
Allows the schema of the destination table to be updated as a side effect of the load job if a schema is autodetected or supplied in the job configuration. Schema update options are supported in two cases: when writeDisposition is WRITE_APPEND; when writeDisposition is WRITE_TRUNCATE and the destination table is a partition of a table, specified by partition decorators. For normal tables, WRITE_TRUNCATE will always overwrite the schema. One or more of the following values are specified:

ALLOW_FIELD_ADDITION: allow adding a nullable field to the schema.
ALLOW_FIELD_RELAXATION: allow relaxing a required field in the original schema to nullable.




timePartitioning

object (TimePartitioning)
Time-based partitioning specification for the destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be specified.



rangePartitioning

object (RangePartitioning)
Range partitioning specification for the destination table. Only one of timePartitioning and rangePartitioning should be specified.



clustering

object (Clustering)
Clustering specification for the destination table.



destinationEncryptionConfiguration

object (EncryptionConfiguration)
Custom encryption configuration (e.g., Cloud KMS keys)



useAvroLogicalTypes

boolean
Optional. If sourceFormat is set to "AVRO", indicates whether to interpret logical types as the corresponding BigQuery data type (for example, TIMESTAMP), instead of using the raw type (for example, INTEGER).



referenceFileSchemaUri

string
Optional. The user can provide a reference file with the reader schema. This file is only loaded if it is part of source URIs, but is not loaded otherwise. It is enabled for the following formats: AVRO, PARQUET, ORC.



hivePartitioningOptions

object (HivePartitioningOptions)
Optional. When set, configures hive partitioning support. Not all storage formats support hive partitioning -- requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error, as will providing an invalid specification.



decimalTargetTypes[]

enum (DecimalTargetType)
Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown.Example: Suppose the value of this field is ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If (precision,scale) is:

(38,9) -> NUMERIC;
(39,9) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits);
(38,10) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits);
(76,38) -> BIGNUMERIC;
(77,38) -> BIGNUMERIC (error if value exceeds supported range).
This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.Defaults to ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"] for the other file formats.



jsonExtension

enum (JsonExtension)
Optional. Load option to be used together with sourceFormat newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and sourceFormat must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).



parquetOptions

object (ParquetOptions)
Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to PARQUET.



preserveAsciiControlCharacters

boolean
Optional. When sourceFormat is set to "CSV", this indicates whether the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from '\x00' to '\x1F') are preserved.



columnNameCharacterMap

enum (ColumnNameCharacterMap)
Optional. Character map supported for column names in CSV/Parquet loads. Defaults to STRICT and can be overridden by Project Config Service. Using this option with unsupporting load formats will result in an error.



copyFilesOnly

boolean
Optional. [Experimental] Configures the load job to copy files directly to the destination BigLake managed table, bypassing file content reading and rewriting.Copying files only is supported when all the following are true:

sourceUris are located in the same Cloud Storage location as the  destination table's storageUri location.
sourceFormat is PARQUET.
destinationTable is an existing BigLake managed table. The table's  schema does not have flexible column names. The table's columns do not  have type parameters other than precision and scale.
No options other than the above are specified.








DestinationTableProperties

Properties for the destination table.
