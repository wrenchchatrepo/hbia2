Fields




etag

string
Output only. A hash of this resource.



routineReference

object (RoutineReference)
Required. Reference describing the ID of this routine.



routineType

enum (RoutineType)
Required. The type of routine.



creationTime

string (int64 format)
Output only. The time when this routine was created, in milliseconds since the epoch.



lastModifiedTime

string (int64 format)
Output only. The time when this routine was last modified, in milliseconds since the epoch.



language

enum (Language)
Optional. Defaults to "SQL" if remoteFunctionOptions field is absent, not set otherwise.



arguments[]

object (Argument)
Optional.



returnType

object (StandardSqlDataType)
Optional if language = "SQL"; required otherwise. Cannot be set if routineType = "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION".If absent, the return type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query that references this routine. If present, then the evaluated result will be cast to the specified returned type at query time.For example, for the functions created with the following statements:

CREATE FUNCTION Add(x FLOAT64, y FLOAT64) RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (x + y);
CREATE FUNCTION Increment(x FLOAT64) AS (Add(x, 1));
CREATE FUNCTION Decrement(x FLOAT64) RETURNS FLOAT64 AS (Add(x, -1));
The returnType is {typeKind: "FLOAT64"} for Add and Decrement, and is absent for Increment (inferred as FLOAT64 at query time).Suppose the function Add is replaced by  CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION Add(x INT64, y INT64) AS (x + y);Then the inferred return type of Increment is automatically changed to INT64 at query time, while the return type of Decrement remains FLOAT64.



returnTableType

object (StandardSqlTableType)
Optional. Can be set only if routineType = "TABLE_VALUED_FUNCTION".If absent, the return table type is inferred from definitionBody at query time in each query that references this routine. If present, then the columns in the evaluated table result will be cast to match the column types specified in return table type, at query time.



importedLibraries[]

string
Optional. If language = "JAVASCRIPT", this field stores the path of the imported JAVASCRIPT libraries.



definitionBody

string
Required. The body of the routine.For functions, this is the expression in the AS clause.If language=SQL, it is the substring inside (but excluding) the parentheses. For example, for the function created with the following statement:CREATE FUNCTION JoinLines(x string, y string) as (concat(x, "\n", y))The definitionBody is concat(x, "\n", y) (\n is not replaced with linebreak).If language=JAVASCRIPT, it is the evaluated string in the AS clause. For example, for the function created with the following statement:CREATE FUNCTION f() RETURNS STRING LANGUAGE js AS 'return "\n";\n'The definitionBody isreturn "\n";\nNote that both \n are replaced with linebreaks.



description

string
Optional. The description of the routine, if defined.



determinismLevel

enum (DeterminismLevel)
Optional. The determinism level of the JavaScript UDF, if defined.



strictMode

boolean
Optional. Use this option to catch many common errors. Error checking is not exhaustive, and successfully creating a procedure doesn't guarantee that the procedure will successfully execute at runtime. If strictMode is set to TRUE, the procedure body is further checked for errors such as non-existent tables or columns. The CREATE PROCEDURE statement fails if the body fails any of these checks.If strictMode is set to FALSE, the procedure body is checked only for syntax. For procedures that invoke themselves recursively, specify strictMode=FALSE to avoid non-existent procedure errors during validation.Default value is TRUE.



remoteFunctionOptions

object (RemoteFunctionOptions)
Optional. Remote function specific options.



sparkOptions

object (SparkOptions)
Optional. Spark specific options.



dataGovernanceType

enum (DataGovernanceType)
Optional. If set to DATA_MASKING, the function is validated and made available as a masking function. For more information, see Create custom masking routines.

ArgumentKind

Represents the kind of a given argument.

    {
      object (StandardSqlField)
    }
  ]
}












Fields




columns[]

object (StandardSqlField)

DeterminismLevel

JavaScript UDF determinism levels.If all JavaScript UDFs are DETERMINISTIC, the query result is potentially cacheable (see below). If any JavaScript UDF is NOT_DETERMINISTIC, the query result is not cacheable.Even if a JavaScript UDF is deterministic, many other factors can prevent usage of cached query results. Example factors include but not limited to: DDL/DML, non-deterministic SQL function calls, update of referenced tables/views/UDFs or imported JavaScript libraries.SQL UDFs cannot have determinism specified. Their determinism is automatically determined.









Enums




DETERMINISM_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED
The determinism of the UDF is unspecified.


DETERMINISTIC
The UDF is deterministic, meaning that 2 function calls with the same inputs always produce the same result, even across 2 query runs.


NOT_DETERMINISTIC
The UDF is not deterministic.
