A wrapper is used here because the default value is True.



privacyPolicy

object (PrivacyPolicy)
Optional. Specifies the privacy policy for the view.







UserDefinedFunctionResource

Optional. The connection specifying the credentials to be used to read external storage, such as Azure Blob, Cloud Storage, or S3. The connectionId can have the form {projectId}.{locationId};{connectionId} or projects/{projectId}/locations/{locationId}/connections/{connectionId}.



decimalTargetTypes[]

enum (DecimalTargetType)
Defines the list of possible SQL data types to which the source decimal values are converted. This list and the precision and the scale parameters of the decimal field determine the target type. In the order of NUMERIC, BIGNUMERIC, and STRING, a type is picked if it is in the specified list and if it supports the precision and the scale. STRING supports all precision and scale values. If none of the listed types supports the precision and the scale, the type supporting the widest range in the specified list is picked, and if a value exceeds the supported range when reading the data, an error will be thrown.Example: Suppose the value of this field is ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"]. If (precision,scale) is:

(38,9) -> NUMERIC;
(39,9) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 30 integer digits);
(38,10) -> BIGNUMERIC (NUMERIC cannot hold 10 fractional digits);
(76,38) -> BIGNUMERIC;
(77,38) -> BIGNUMERIC (error if value exceeds supported range).
This field cannot contain duplicate types. The order of the types in this field is ignored. For example, ["BIGNUMERIC", "NUMERIC"] is the same as ["NUMERIC", "BIGNUMERIC"] and NUMERIC always takes precedence over BIGNUMERIC.Defaults to ["NUMERIC", "STRING"] for ORC and ["NUMERIC"] for the other file formats.



avroOptions

object (AvroOptions)
Optional. Additional properties to set if sourceFormat is set to AVRO.



jsonExtension

enum (JsonExtension)
Optional. Load option to be used together with sourceFormat newline-delimited JSON to indicate that a variant of JSON is being loaded. To load newline-delimited GeoJSON, specify GEOJSON (and sourceFormat must be set to NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON).



parquetOptions

object (ParquetOptions)

string
Optional. When creating an external table, the user can provide a reference file with the table schema. This is enabled for the following formats: AVRO, PARQUET, ORC.



metadataCacheMode

enum (MetadataCacheMode)
Optional. Metadata Cache Mode for the table. Set this to enable caching of metadata from external data source.



objectMetadata

enum (ObjectMetadata)
Optional. ObjectMetadata is used to create Object Tables. Object Tables contain a listing of objects (with their metadata) found at the sourceUris. If ObjectMetadata is set, sourceFormat should be omitted.Currently SIMPLE is the only supported Object Metadata type.







FileSetSpecType

This enum defines how to interpret source URIs for load jobs and external tables.









Enums




FILE_SET_SPEC_TYPE_FILE_SYSTEM_MATCH

FILE_SET_SPEC_TYPE_NEW_LINE_DELIMITED_MANIFEST
This option indicates that the provided URIs are newline-delimited manifest files, with one URI per line. Wildcard URIs are not supported.






CsvOptions

Information related to a CSV data source.





JSON representation




{
  "fieldDelimiter": string,
  "skipLeadingRows": string,
  "quote": string,
  "allowQuotedNewlines": boolean,
  "allowJaggedRows": boolean,
  "encoding": string,
  "preserveAsciiControlCharacters": boolean,
  "nullMarker": string
}












Fields




fieldDelimiter

string
Optional. The separator character for fields in a CSV file. The separator is interpreted as a single byte. For files encoded in ISO-8859-1, any single character can be used as a separator. For files encoded in UTF-8, characters represented in decimal range 1-127 (U+0001-U+007F) can be used without any modification. UTF-8 characters encoded with multiple bytes (i.e. U+0080 and above) will have only the first byte used for separating fields. The remaining bytes will be treated as a part of the field. BigQuery also supports the escape sequence "\t" (U+0009) to specify a tab separator. The default value is comma (",", U+002C).



skipLeadingRows

string (Int64Value format)
Optional. The number of rows at the top of a CSV file that BigQuery will skip when reading the data. The default value is 0. This property is useful if you have header rows in the file that should be skipped. When autodetect is on, the behavior is the following:

skipLeadingRows unspecified - Autodetect tries to detect headers in the  first row. If they are not detected, the row is read as data. Otherwise  data is read starting from the second row.
skipLeadingRows is 0 - Instructs autodetect that there are no headers and  data should be read starting from the first row.
skipLeadingRows = N > 0 - Autodetect skips N-1 rows and tries to detect  headers in row N. If headers are not detected, row N is just skipped.  Otherwise row N is used to extract column names for the detected schema.




quote

string
Optional. The value that is used to quote data sections in a CSV file. BigQuery converts the string to ISO-8859-1 encoding, and then uses the first byte of the encoded string to split the data in its raw, binary state. The default value is a double-quote ("). If your data does not contain quoted sections, set the property value to an empty string. If your data contains quoted newline characters, you must also set the allowQuotedNewlines property to true. To include the specific quote character within a quoted value, precede it with an additional matching quote character. For example, if you want to escape the default character ' " ', use ' "" '.



allowQuotedNewlines

boolean
Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should allow quoted data sections that contain newline characters in a CSV file. The default value is false.



allowJaggedRows

boolean
Optional. Indicates if BigQuery should accept rows that are missing trailing optional columns. If true, BigQuery treats missing trailing columns as null values. If false, records with missing trailing columns are treated as bad records, and if there are too many bad records, an invalid error is returned in the job result. The default value is false.



encoding

string
Optional. The character encoding of the data. The supported values are UTF-8, ISO-8859-1, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. The default value is UTF-8. BigQuery decodes the data after the raw, binary data has been split using the values of the quote and fieldDelimiter properties.



preserveAsciiControlCharacters

boolean
Optional. Indicates if the embedded ASCII control characters (the first 32 characters in the ASCII-table, from '\x00' to '\x1F') are preserved.



nullMarker

string
Optional. Specifies a string that represents a null value in a CSV file. For example, if you specify "\N", BigQuery interprets "\N" as a null value when querying a CSV file. The default value is the empty string. If you set this property to a custom value, BigQuery throws an error if an empty string is present for all data types except for STRING and BYTE. For STRING and BYTE columns, BigQuery interprets the empty string as an empty value.







JsonOptions

AUTO: automatically infer partition key name(s) and type(s).
STRINGS: automatically infer partition key name(s). All types are strings.
CUSTOM: partition key schema is encoded in the source URI prefix.
Not all storage formats support hive partitioning. Requesting hive partitioning on an unsupported format will lead to an error. Currently supported formats are: JSON, CSV, ORC, Avro and Parquet.



sourceUriPrefix

string
Optional. When hive partition detection is requested, a common prefix for all source uris must be required. The prefix must end immediately before the partition key encoding begins. For example, consider files following this data layout:gs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-06-01/country=USA/id=7/file.avrogs://bucket/path_to_table/dt=2019-05-31/country=CA/id=3/file.avroWhen hive partitioning is requested with either AUTO or STRINGS detection, the common prefix can be either of gs://bucket/path_to_table or gs://bucket/path_to_table/.CUSTOM detection requires encoding the partitioning schema immediately after the common prefix. For CUSTOM, any of

gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER}
gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:STRING}/{country:STRING}/{id:INTEGER}
gs://bucket/path_to_table/{dt:DATE}/{country:STRING}/{id:STRING}
would all be valid source URI prefixes.



requirePartitionFilter

boolean
Optional. If set to true, queries over this table require a partition filter that can be used for partition elimination to be specified.Note that this field should only be true when creating a permanent external table or querying a temporary external table.Hive-partitioned loads with requirePartitionFilter explicitly set to true will fail.



fields[]

string
Output only. For permanent external tables, this field is populated with the hive partition keys in the order they were inferred. The types of the partition keys can be deduced by checking the table schema (which will include the partition keys). Not every API will populate this field in the output.
